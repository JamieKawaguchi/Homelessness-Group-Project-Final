# Homelessness-Group-Project-Final
# Description

This data analytics study seeks to investigate varying conditions across the states of the U.S. that we think make homelessness a more viable proposition. The conditions we are studying are public policy, sheltering resources, and weather/climate. For public policy, our working hypothesis is that more states with more laws restricting the activity of homeless persons (i.e., laws banning camping in public, sleeping in public, living in vehicles, loitering, and pandhandling), will have lower rates of homelessness than states with more "lax" laws. For sheltering, we hyptothesize that states with more sheltering resources will have higher rates of homelessness than those with fewer resources. For weather/climate, we hypothesize that milder weather conditions with very few hot humid summers and cold frigid winters will make homelessness more viable.
